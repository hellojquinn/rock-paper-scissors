The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors game

27/11/2022:

Initial browser-console version of this game has been completed and it was a lot of fun. I was able to complete the majority of it without having to follow a guide where a round was able to be played out and the winner to be detemined, and then a score point allocated to the winner, but my for loop wouldn't initiate the prompt again to allow the next input choice and so the player was not able to proceed to the 2nd round, requiring a page refresh only to start back at round 1 again.

After much headache, I followed a guide I found on YT by a channel called Coding with Rob, to which I was able to complete the assignment by following the guide.

I have dated this entry above as I am intending to come back and rewrite it again myself without the use of a guide so I can gauge to what my issue was previously.
